# Hospital-Nursing-Intervention-Pilot-Program

This project involved analyzing hospital data using data analytics techniques to identify insights for leadership decision-making. Dimension tables like "bed_type" and "business" and a fact table "bed_fact" were used to structure the data. Top-performing hospitals with the highest number of ICU or SICU beds were identified, and potential pilot sites for hiring nursing candidates were suggested based on the analysis. The project demonstrated the value of data analytics in optimizing intensive care unit utilization and enhancing patient care in hospitals.
